## Description

‚ÄúE-books are great for instant gratification - you see a review somewhere of a book that interests you, and you can start reading it five minutes later‚Äù ‚Äì Anne Lamott.

‚ÄúIf you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.‚Äù ‚Äï Haruki Murakami

With BookShoot users can take photos of books that interests them and then instantly read reviews on it, recommendations for similar books and adding reviews. BookShoot makes use of on-device machine learning (google ML Kit ) for the recommendation system, it recommends books and authors as it learns the users preferences through user activity. 
Users can get book details  by following ways  : 

- taking book photos using the camera
- using photos  that are on the device 
- searching for the books using title/author/isbn
